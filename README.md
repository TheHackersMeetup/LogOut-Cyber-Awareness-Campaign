# LogOut-Cyber-Awareness-Campaign
We are planning for pan India campaign where we will reach out to maximum fellow Indians, our aim is to aware them about cyber security, what is privacy, cyber war, encryption, cybercrime, how to prevent cyber-crime and cyber law. To reach the target of minimum 50,000 people we need army of awesome people who can spare some time to teach people and educate them about cyber security. We are signing up people for our campaign from different-different city from all over India because we want to achieve big target but we cannot reach everywhere so we need local support from local resident from the places we are doing.
